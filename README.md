# 🛡️ Admin-Only Group Chat (Broadcast System)

A modern **group chat system** where **only admins can send messages, images, or links**, while regular users can **view messages only** — similar to a **broadcast channel** (like Telegram or Instagram broadcast).

This repository includes **10 complete implementations** across different stacks — Node.js, Firebase, Django, Laravel, Go, .NET, Elixir, Flutter, and more — so you can choose what best fits your needs.
